    "- You have to close the slam_gmapping node\n",
    "- you launched an amcl node using the preconfigured amcl_demo.launch file.\n",
    "- you set up an initial pose by using the 2D Pose Estimate tool (which published that pose to the /initialpose topic).\n",
    "- Then, you started moving the robot around the room, and the amcl node began reading the data published into the laser topic (/scan), the map topic(/map), and the transform topic (/tf), and published the estimated pose where the robot was in to the /amcl_pose and the /particlecloud topics.\n",
    "- Finally, via RViz, you accesed the data being published by this node into the /particlecloud topic, so you were able to vizualize it, thanks to the cloud of \"arrows,\" which were indicating the most probable position the robot was in, and its orientation.\n",
